## Fixed: Indicator Values Now Display and Update Correctly!

### The Problem:
- Values were being saved to observations.ndjson correctly
- BUT the UI was hardcoded to always show 0.0 instead of reading actual values
- When entering update mode, it always started at 0 instead of current value

### Root Cause:
Two TODO comments that were never implemented:
1. In UI rendering: 'TODO: Fetch actual indicator values from observations'
2. In update mode: 'TODO: In the future, load from observations file'

### The Fix:
1. ✅ Added `get_latest_indicator_value()` function to read from observations
2. ✅ UI now displays actual current values from observations  
3. ✅ Update mode pre-fills with current value instead of 0
4. ✅ Values persist between sessions and show correctly

### How It Works Now:
- Indicators show their actual values in the main UI (e.g., 5/25 for count)
- Progress bars reflect real progress
- Update mode shows 'Current: 5.0' instead of always 'Current: 0.0'
- When you press 'u', it pre-fills with the current value
- All values are read from the observations.ndjson file

### Test It:
```bash
./target/release/focusfive
```
Your last observation was 5.0, so indicators should now show that value!
