# FocusFive Claude Code Integration and Automation Research

## Background & Problem Framing

### Integration Challenges for Local TUI with Claude Code

FocusFive presents unique integration challenges as a local-first, terminal-based goal tracking application seeking seamless integration with Claude Code's AI-powered analysis capabilities:

**Local vs. Cloud Context Management**: Claude Code operates in cloud environments with access to remote APIs, while FocusFive maintains strict local-only data storage. This creates fundamental tension between FocusFive's privacy requirements and Claude Code's need for context access.

**Terminal Interface Limitations**: FocusFive's TUI operates in constrained terminal environments, requiring integration patterns that work across SSH sessions, mobile terminals, and various platform configurations. Traditional web-based integration approaches are not applicable.

**Export Workflow Complexity**: The requirement for "one-click export" from a TUI environment necessitates sophisticated export orchestration that can:
- Generate Claude-optimized export formats
- Automatically invoke Claude Code with proper context loading
- Handle authentication and session management
- Provide results back to the local environment

**Context Preservation Challenges**: Claude Code's memory system (CLAUDE.md) and project context management must be populated with FocusFive-specific information without requiring manual setup for each analysis session.

**Automation Scale Requirements**: Supporting daily reviews and weekly retrospectives requires automation patterns that can:
- Process varying time ranges of goal data
- Generate consistent analysis formats
- Handle both automated (CI/CD) and manual (TUI) triggering
- Maintain analysis history and trend tracking

**Privacy and Security Boundaries**: Local-only data requirements create complex boundaries around what data can be exported, how it's transmitted, and where analysis occurs, while maintaining the user's privacy expectations.

## Exploration & Brainstorming

### Option 1: Static Export with Manual Claude Invocation

**Design Overview**: FocusFive generates standardized export files optimized for Claude Code analysis, which users manually import into Claude Code sessions using the @import syntax in CLAUDE.md files.

**Export Workflow Architecture**:
```
FocusFive TUI → Export Command → Markdown Files → Manual Claude Code Session
    ↓                ↓              ↓                    ↓
Daily Goals     JSON Metadata   CLAUDE.md Import    AI Analysis
```

**Export File Structure**:
```
.focusfive-exports/
├── daily-export-2025-01-15.md
├── weekly-summary-2025-W03.md
├── metadata.json
├── analysis-context.md
└── claude-instructions.md
```

**Claude Code Configuration Integration**:
```markdown
# CLAUDE.md
See @.focusfive-exports/analysis-context.md for FocusFive goal tracking context.

# FocusFive Analysis Instructions
- @.focusfive-exports/claude-instructions.md

# Current Export
- @.focusfive-exports/daily-export-2025-01-15.md
```

**Pros**:
- **Complete Privacy Control**: All data export decisions made explicitly by user
- **Simple Implementation**: Minimal integration complexity in FocusFive
- **Universal Compatibility**: Works with any Claude Code installation or configuration
- **Manual Oversight**: User reviews all exported data before analysis
- **No Authentication Requirements**: Leverages existing Claude Code user authentication

**Cons**:
- **Manual Overhead**: Requires explicit file management and import steps
- **Context Fragmentation**: Each analysis session requires manual context reconstruction
- **No Automation**: Cannot support automated daily/weekly review workflows
- **Export Staleness**: Risk of analyzing outdated exports
- **Limited Integration**: No bidirectional communication for follow-up analysis

**Implementation Details**:
- Export templates optimized for Claude Code's markdown processing
- JSON metadata for structured analysis (goals, timelines, metrics)
- Standardized file naming for consistent @import patterns
- User-configurable export privacy levels (anonymization options)

### Option 2: Dynamic Integration with MCP (Model Context Protocol)

**Design Overview**: FocusFive implements a custom MCP server that provides real-time access to goal data, enabling Claude Code to query current state, historical trends, and perform live analysis without file exports.

**MCP Server Architecture**:
```
Claude Code ←→ MCP Protocol ←→ FocusFive MCP Server ←→ Local Data Store
     ↓               ↓                ↓                    ↓
AI Analysis    Tools/Resources   Goal Queries        Markdown Files
```

**FocusFive MCP Server Capabilities**:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "focusfive": {
      "command": "focusfive-mcp-server",
      "args": ["--data-dir", "~/.focusfive"],
      "env": {"PRIVACY_LEVEL": "standard"}
    }
  }
}
```

**MCP Tools and Resources**:
- `mcp__focusfive__get_daily_goals`: Retrieve specific day's goals and progress
- `mcp__focusfive__get_weekly_summary`: Generate weekly progress analysis
- `mcp__focusfive__get_trends`: Extract completion patterns and streaks
- `mcp__focusfive__query_actions`: Search actions by outcome, timeframe, status
- `@focusfive:daily://2025-01-15`: Direct resource access to daily data

**Claude Code Integration Patterns**:
```
> Analyze my professional outcome progress for this week
> Compare @focusfive:weekly://2025-W03 with previous week trends
> /mcp__focusfive__get_trends professional 30-days
```

**Authentication and Privacy Models**:
- **Local Token Authentication**: FocusFive generates session tokens for MCP access
- **Privacy Levels**: Configurable data exposure (full, anonymized, summary-only)
- **Consent Prompts**: Real-time permission requests for sensitive data access
- **Audit Logging**: Track all external data access with user notification

**Pros**:
- **Real-Time Data**: Always current information without export/import cycles
- **Rich Query Capabilities**: Complex analysis across arbitrary time ranges
- **Automated Integration**: Supports CI/CD workflows with live data access
- **Bidirectional Communication**: Claude can trigger FocusFive actions (goal updates)
- **Flexible Privacy**: Granular control over data exposure levels

**Cons**:
- **Implementation Complexity**: Requires sophisticated MCP server development
- **Runtime Dependencies**: FocusFive must run MCP server alongside TUI
- **Network Requirements**: May not work in all terminal/SSH configurations
- **Privacy Coordination**: Complex consent and audit systems required
- **Resource Overhead**: Additional process management and monitoring

**Security and Privacy Architecture**:
```
User Consent Layer → Privacy Filter → MCP Protocol → Claude Code
       ↓                  ↓             ↓              ↓
   Permissions      Data Anonymization  Secure Transport  AI Analysis
```

### Option 3: Hybrid Template-Based Exports with Custom Commands

**Design Overview**: FocusFive generates template-based exports with embedded Claude Code commands, creating self-executing analysis packages that automatically configure Claude Code context and execute predefined analysis workflows.

**Hybrid Export Architecture**:
```
FocusFive → Template Engine → Smart Export Package → Auto-Claude Execution
    ↓           ↓                  ↓                       ↓
Goal Data   Analysis Templates   Executable Scripts    Automated Analysis
```

**Smart Export Package Structure**:

## Key Tradeoffs/Limitations

### Integration Architecture Constraints

**Authentication and API Key Management**: All integration approaches require secure management of Claude Code authentication credentials. Option 1 relies on user's existing Claude Code setup, Option 2 requires complex token management for MCP servers, and Option 3 needs automated API key handling for CI/CD workflows.

**Privacy vs. Functionality Trade-offs**: More sophisticated integration (Option 2) provides richer functionality but requires more data exposure and complex privacy controls. Option 1 maintains maximum privacy but limits automation capabilities. Option 3 attempts to balance both but adds complexity.

**Network and Platform Dependencies**: Option 2's MCP approach may not function in all terminal environments, particularly restricted SSH sessions or corporate networks. Option 3's automation dependencies on Claude Code CLI installation and network access for CI/CD limit portability.

**Maintenance and Evolution Burden**: Option 1 requires minimal ongoing maintenance but provides limited evolution path. Option 2 requires significant MCP server maintenance and protocol compatibility tracking. Option 3 requires template maintenance and automation pipeline management.

### Security and Privacy Considerations

**Data Exposure Boundaries**: Local-first architecture conflicts with cloud-based AI analysis requirements. Each option handles this differently:
- Option 1: User-controlled explicit exports with full privacy transparency
- Option 2: Runtime consent with granular privacy controls but more complex boundaries
- Option 3: Automated exports with template-defined privacy policies

**Authentication Security Models**: 
- Option 1: Leverages user's existing Claude Code authentication, minimizing additional attack surface
- Option 2: Requires additional authentication infrastructure for MCP servers
- Option 3: Requires secure API key storage and automated authentication flows

**Analysis Result Security**: All options must consider how AI analysis results are stored, transmitted, and integrated back into local systems. Options 2 and 3 require secure bidirectional communication channels.

### Scalability and Performance Limitations

**Export Generation Performance**: As FocusFive datasets grow over multiple years, export generation becomes computationally expensive. Option 1 generates static exports, Option 2 performs real-time queries, Option 3 generates complex template packages.

**Claude Code Processing Limits**: Large historical datasets may exceed Claude Code's context limits or processing capabilities. Each option must implement pagination, summarization, or filtering strategies.

**Automation Scaling**: Options 2 and 3 that support automation must handle varying data volumes and analysis complexity without degrading performance or exceeding API rate limits.

**Mobile and SSH Constraints**: All options must work effectively over mobile SSH sessions with limited bandwidth and intermittent connectivity, requiring offline capability and efficient data transmission.

### User Experience and Adoption Challenges

**Setup Complexity**: Each option presents different setup challenges:
- Option 1: Minimal setup but manual workflow overhead
- Option 2: Complex MCP server configuration and privacy setup
- Option 3: Template configuration and automation pipeline setup

**Learning Curve**: Users must understand export workflows, Claude Code integration patterns, and analysis result interpretation. More sophisticated options require greater technical understanding.

**Error Recovery and Debugging**: When integrations fail, users need clear error messages and recovery paths. Option 2's runtime complexity creates more failure modes. Option 3's automation pipelines require troubleshooting capabilities.

**Workflow Disruption**: Integration should enhance rather than disrupt existing FocusFive workflows. Options requiring significant workflow changes may face adoption resistance.

## Recommendation & Next Steps

### Recommended Approach: Hybrid Evolution Strategy

After comprehensive analysis of Claude Code's capabilities and FocusFive's requirements, I recommend implementing a **staged evolution strategy** beginning with Option 1's simplicity and progressively enhancing toward Option 3's automation capabilities, with selective Option 2 features for advanced users.

This recommendation balances immediate user value delivery, technical risk management, and long-term automation requirements while respecting FocusFive's core privacy and local-first principles.
