## üí° Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Quick Access Aliases
```bash
# Add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc
alias focus='~/projects/goal_setting/target/release/focusfive'
alias goals='cd ~/FocusFive/goals'
alias today='vim ~/FocusFive/goals/$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md'
alias progress='grep -c "\[x\]" ~/FocusFive/goals/$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md'
```

### Tip 2: Quick Edit Commands
```bash
# Mark task complete (if you know the line number)
sed -i '' '7s/\[ \]/\[x\]/' ~/FocusFive/goals/$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md

# See today's goals
cat ~/FocusFive/goals/$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md

# See this week's files
ls -la ~/FocusFive/goals/*.md | tail -7
```

### Tip 3: Track Your Streak
```bash
# Count consecutive days with goals
ls ~/FocusFive/goals/*.md | wc -l

# See completion rate over time
for f in ~/FocusFive/goals/*.md; do
    echo -n "$(basename $f): "
    echo "$(grep -c '\[x\]' $f)/9 completed"
done
```

### Tip 4: Git Integration
```bash
cd ~/FocusFive/goals
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Goals for $(date +%Y-%m-%d)"

# Daily commit
echo "git add . && git commit -m 'EOD $(date +%Y-%m-%d)'" >> ~/.zshrc
alias eod='cd ~/FocusFive/goals && git add . && git commit -m "EOD $(date +%Y-%m-%d)"'
```

## üóìÔ∏è Weekly Review

### See the Week's Progress
```bash
# Create a weekly summary
for f in ~/FocusFive/goals/*.md; do
    if [ -f "$f" ]; then
        echo "=== $(basename $f .md) ==="
        echo "Completed: $(grep -c '\[x\]' $f)/9"
        echo "Work: $(grep -A3 '^## Work' $f | grep -c '\[x\]')/3"
        echo "Health: $(grep -A3 '^## Health' $f | grep -c '\[x\]')/3"
        echo "Family: $(grep -A3 '^## Family' $f | grep -c '\[x\]')/3"
        echo ""
    fi
done
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Issue: Command+Enter not saving
**Solution**: Use **F2** or **Ctrl+S** instead - these work universally across all terminals

### Issue: Can't save vision/reflection (Enter adds newlines)
**Solution**: Use **F2**, **Ctrl+S**, or **Ctrl+Enter** to save multi-line content

### Issue: Template creation with 'T' not working
**Solution**: Make sure you're pressing capital T (Shift+T). If that doesn't work, check if your terminal passes through shift modifiers

### Issue: Actions still showing after delete
**Solution**: Press **s** to manually save, or changes will auto-save when you quit with **q**

### Issue: "No goal set" showing
**Solution**: Press **g** in the Outcomes pane to edit the goal for that outcome

### Issue: Progress count not updating
**Solution**: The count updates dynamically as you add/remove actions. If stuck, press **s** to save and refresh

### Issue: Can't add more than 3 actions
**Solution**: Press **a** when in Actions pane to add up to 5 actions per outcome

### Issue: Info messages showing as errors
**Solution**: Green messages are info, red are errors. This is working correctly in latest version

## üì± Mobile Access (Bonus)

### Using iCloud Drive
```bash
# Move goals to iCloud
mv ~/FocusFive ~/Library/Mobile\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/
ln -s ~/Library/Mobile\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/FocusFive ~/FocusFive

# Now edit on iPhone/iPad with any markdown app
```

### Using Git + Working Copy (iOS)
```bash
# Push to GitHub
cd ~/FocusFive/goals
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/goals.git
git push -u origin main

# Clone in Working Copy app on iOS
# Edit goals on the go!
```

## üéâ You're Ready!

Start using the Terminal UI now:
```bash
# Just one command needed!
focus

# That's it! Everything else is done through the TUI:
# - Edit actions with 'e'
# - Set goals with 'g'  
# - Define visions with 'v'
# - Add/remove actions with 'a'/'d'
# - Save templates with 'T'
# - Mark complete with Space
# - Quick complete in evening with letter keys
# - Save changes with 's' or auto-save on quit
```

## üìä File Locations

FocusFive creates these directories:
- `~/FocusFive/goals/` - Daily markdown files
- `~/FocusFive/reflections/` - End-of-day reflections
- `~/FocusFive/visions/` - Long-term visions
- `~/.focusfive_templates.json` - Saved templates

## üîë Key Principles

1. **Variable Actions**: 1-5 actions per outcome (not fixed at 3)
2. **Ritual Phases**: Morning for planning, Evening for reflection
3. **Templates**: Save time with reusable action sets
4. **Goals & Visions**: Short-term goals + long-term visions
5. **3-Minute Daily**: Quick morning setup, quick evening review

Remember: **3 outcomes, variable actions, 3 minutes per day!**
